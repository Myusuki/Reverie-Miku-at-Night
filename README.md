# Reverie-Miku-at-Night
Hello everyone to my first rice. This is my first time ricing so I'm inexeperienced at a lot of things here. If you have any suggestions please notify me so, though be warned that I'm still a noob to Linux. Thank you all for viewing my rice and a huge thanks to the r/unixporn community for opening my eyes to aesthetic desktops.
